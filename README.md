## Nearest Positive Definite C++ Implementation
Most recently, I have been writing an implementation of the R *nearPD()* function in C++. Given an "almost" Positive Definite matrix, this function runs an iterative algorithm that converges to the nearest (in the Frobenius Norm) Positive Definite matrix. One use case is finding the nearest correlation matrix when portions of the original "correlation" matrix may have been calculated using slightly different time periods. The convergence of *nearPD()* may be quite slow for large matrices, which motivates this implementation in C++. I will be adding test files quantifying the speed improvements. 

## [Conditional Random Field](https://github.com/arob5/conditional-random-field.git)  
I implemented a Linear Chain Conditional Random Field from scratch in Scala. This is a simplified implementation using basic feature functions, not an attempt to compete with the state-of-the-art models currently being used in NLP settings. My CRF implementation is trained on text data and used to label words as nouns, verbs, or adjectives. 

## [Climate Change and Malaria Research Proposal](https://github.com/arob5/climate-change-and-malaria-research-proposal.git)
For an undergraduate senior year elective, I wrote a research proposal for an econometric analysis of the effect of climate change on malaria in Brazil. This proposal was motivated by a literature review of the relevant epidemiologic and economic literature. The data to actually run the proposed analysis exists but is not publicly available.  

## [Principal Component Analysis used for Image Compression](https://github.com/arob5/PCA-Image-Compression.git)
Here I apply PCA to the well-known Olivetti faces dataset to perform image compression. Accompanying the code is a paper summarizing the methodology and results.
