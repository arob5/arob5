## [Propagating Surrogate Uncertainty in Bayesian Inverse Problems](https://github.com/arob5/Bayesian-inference-with-surrogates.git)
Houses the code for the paper [Propagating Surrogate Uncertainty in Bayesian Inverse Problems](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2601.03532), as well 
as a synthesis/review paper on uncertainty quantification/active learning with probabilistic surrogate models that should be up on 
arXiv shortly.
