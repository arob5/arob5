# Some Course Projects

## [Document Clustering and Topic Modeling: NNMF compared to SVD and K-Means](https://github.com/arob5/document-clustering-and-topic-modeling-paper.git)
This analysis evaluates the performance of the Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NNMF) for two NLP tasks: document clustering and topic modeling. The document clustering and topic modeling results are compared to K-Means and the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), respectively. The code is written in Scala and included is a paper summarizing the methodology and results.  

## [Conditional Random Field](https://github.com/arob5/conditional-random-field.git)  
I implemented a Linear Chain Conditional Random Field from scratch in Scala. This is a simplified implementation using basic feature functions, not an attempt to compete with the state-of-the-art models currently being used in NLP settings. My CRF implementation is trained on text data and used to label words as nouns, verbs, or adjectives. 

## [Principal Component Analysis used for Image Compression](https://github.com/arob5/PCA-Image-Compression.git)
Here I apply PCA to the well-known Olivetti faces dataset to perform image compression. Accompanying the code is a paper summarizing the methodology and results. 

## [Unsupervised Clustering Analysis on Boston Housing Dataset](https://github.com/arob5/boston-housing-data-clustering-analysis.git)
I perform an unsupervised analysis on the Boston Housing Dataset using PCA and K-Means. This well-known dataset is typically analyzed via supervised methods, so this analysis serves to look more closely at the stucture of the feature space. Accompanying the code is a paper summarizing the methodology and results.
